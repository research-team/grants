#MS Motivation Letter

##Intro

Currently the Machine cognition lab is concentrated on the problem of machine consciousness.
Sometimes this is called the "complex problem of AI".
As this was indicated that for humans following logical dependency works see Damasio in (Damasio 1998) and
Panksepp(Panksepp 2005):

**Cognition -> Consciousness -> Emotions**

We have started with the simulation of emotions in the computational system. Original idea was inherited form
Hugo LÃ¶vheim "Cube of emotions" (Lovheim 2012) that build the bridge between psychological phenomena of affects,
in its turn inherited from Tomkins "Theory of Affects" (Tomkins 1962, 1963, 1981, 1991) to neurobiological
mechanisms of monoamines neuromodulators: dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline. 

##Problem

Currently our lab capabilities are quite modest and we could afford to calculate the model of
only half a million of neurons that have no analogy in mammalian world. To progress in more
interesting and promising task simulating the emotional mechanism closer to realistic: mice,
rats, cats, monkeys we need further computational power. We consider MS Asure Cloud as ideal
platform for the scientific research projects that provides options like scalability and robustness.
